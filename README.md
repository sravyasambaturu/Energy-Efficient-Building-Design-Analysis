# Energy-Efficient-Building-Design-Analysis

Energy-Efficient Building Design Analysis (Python, SAS JMP Pro, Regression, Clustering, Data Visualization)

Analyzed a dataset of simulated building designs to evaluate factors influencing heating and cooling loads.

Performed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and clustering to classify building configurations by energy demand.

Built multiple regression models, achieving R² ≈ 0.89 (heating) and 0.92 (cooling), identifying glazing area, height, and wall area as most significant predictors.

Conducted residual analysis to detect non-linear patterns, outliers, and model limitations, suggesting improvements with non-linear regression and interaction terms.

Delivered insights on design strategies that optimize energy efficiency while reducing operational costs.
